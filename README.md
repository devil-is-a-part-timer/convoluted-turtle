👋 Thank you for taking the time and visiting my github profile.

I believe that experience comes from being open to opportunities that one comes across and not being afraid to take risks. I have been fortunate to dabble in several different areas of business such as Financial analysis, Market research, Operations optimization and management roles which have helped me develop a well rounded perspective to each opportunity I am presented with.

I don’t claim to be an expert in a particular field as I believe that the term "expert" is a title that others must bestow upon you. As I continue to hone my craft I am supported by my strong work ethic, business intuition, strategic thinking, creative problem solving and being a quick learner. No matter the experience level or how astute you are, no one can do everything by themselves. Having a solid team environment around you can sometimes be the reason between success and failure.

I love meeting new professional acquaintances across all spectrums of the business world. If you want to talk Business, Finance, Research, IT, Hospitality, Data Science/Analytics, Chess, Cricket, Books or anything you fancy, please feel free to reach out - dshah382@gatech.edu
